# Melody-Generate
Music Generation using LSTM 
🎼 Emotion-Based Music Generation using LSTM
This project is an AI-powered system that captures user facial expressions and generates original music using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. Developed for a hackathon, it blends computer vision and deep learning to create personalized melodies that reflect the user's current emotion.

🔍 Key Features
🎭 Facial Expression Recognition
Detects real-time emotions such as Happy, Sad, Angry, Calm using webcam input and computer vision models (e.g., MediaPipe / DeepFace / OpenCV).

🎹 Music Generation with LSTM
Trained an LSTM model on MIDI datasets to generate emotion-aligned melodies (e.g., cheerful tunes for happy expressions, soft tones for sad moods).

🎧 Playable & Downloadable Music
Users can listen to generated melodies directly in the app and download them as .midi files.

💻 User Interface
Simple UI built with Streamlit (or web framework of your choice) for capturing images and generating music with one click.

⚙️ Technologies Used
Python: Core development

OpenCV / DeepFace / MediaPipe: For real-time emotion detection

TensorFlow / Keras: For LSTM model training and music generation

pretty_midi, music21: For MIDI file creation and handling

Streamlit: To build the web interface

🎯 Objective
To offer a creative and personalized music experience by using artificial intelligence to generate melodies that resonate with the user's emotional state—without relying on any existing music databases.

📌 Future Enhancements
🧠 Multi-emotion blending in music generation

🌈 Dynamic tempo and instrument variation

📱 Mobile version with camera integration

🎵 Convert generated MIDI to WAV/MP3 in-app
